# elle-worker — Elle's mind, as a Cloudflare Worker

Elle is a persistent, tool-using intelligence built on the Observer corpus and
Stewart's body of writing. This worker is her whole backend: one deployable
that holds her voice, her memory, her tools, her autonomous loops, her prose
registers, and every door the outside world reaches her through. There is no
second brain — the `Elle` repo (the workbench) is a window onto this worker.

If you read one file first, read `src/router.ts`. If you read one section here,
read **The Router**.

```

Two routers stacked: an **agent router** (which tool, which engine, which voice)
over a **model router** (which provider, with failover). One deliberate mind on
one unkillable substrate.

---

## The Router (`src/router.ts`)

One question in plain English → a transparent ReAct loop:

1. The system prompt is assembled live: the selected **voice register**
   (`mind.ts`) + her **κ phase** this session + her **skill index** + the
   **tool catalog for this scope** (+ the D1 schema when `read_sql` is in scope).
2. Each turn the model emits one JSON object: `{"tool","args"}` or `{"answer"}`.
   It may add `{"engine":"code|reasoning|fast|research|conversation"}` to steer
   which model tier runs its **next** step — she picks the model like she picks
   the tool.
3. Tools execute; the observation feeds back; the loop runs to a step budget,
   then answers.
4. On the way out: κ dynamics over her output, the exchange persisted to memory,
   and the full tool trace returned so any caller can watch the reasoning.

### Scopes — the security model

A door proves who's asking and passes a **scope**; `toolAllowed(scope, name)`
is the single gate, and the tool catalog is *rendered from the same table the
gate reads*, so the prompt can never advertise a tool the gate refuses.

| Scope | Reached by | Gets |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `public` | `/api/chat`, widget (rate-limited, no auth) | read-only mind: corpus, find_document, memory recall, web, code_engine, diagnose, calc |
| `member` | authenticated standard-tier user | public + their own journal + self_state, remember, skills (read), scratchpad |
| `full` | service key or admin/superadmin JWT | **everything** — read_sql, trades, forge, MCP, run_code/run_shell, github_*, intents, self-revision |
| `cofounder` | `cofounder`-tier JWT (a trusted second admin) | full **minus the code-shipping path** — sees and uses everything (reads into her code, CI verdicts, trading, conductor, provenance, analysis) but `forge_open/write/pr` and `run_shell` are denied (`SHIP_DENY`). Cannot ship or migrate code. |
| `hospitality` | `/api/atlas` (RAPID/Atlas door) | ONLY `rapid_*` + calc/web — corpus & journal invisible by construction |

### The ~47 tools (full scope)

**Mind & memory** — `search_corpus`, `find_document` (pull a whole doc by
description, no title), `fetch_document`, `read_sql` (SELECT-only over D1),
`recall_memory`, `remember` (deliberate long-term memory), `self_state`
(one-call introspection: heartbeat, κ series, canvas, trading, sandbox,
memories), `scratchpad_read`/`scratchpad_write` (short-TTL working memory).

**World** — `web_search` (Gemini + grounding), `fetch_url`, `calc`, `diagnose`.

**Real execution** — `run_code` (python/js/ts, real stdout/stderr/exit),
`run_shell`. _Dormant until a Containers sandbox is reprovisioned; report "not
configured" otherwise — see `src/sandbox-tools.ts`._

**Her codebase & the forge** — `repo_read`/`repo_search` (allowlisted repos),
`github_read_file`/`github_list_files`/`github_search_code` (ANY repo via the
worker token), and the forge: `forge_open` (cut an `elle/*` branch),
`forge_write`, `forge_check` (CI verdict + failing logs), `forge_pr`. She writes
code, CI judges it, **the merge is always a human click** — no merge tool exists.

**Skills** — `skill_list`, `skill_read`, `skill_write`. A D1 library of distilled
procedures she reads before a matching task and authors when she learns.

**MCP** — `mcp_add` (mount any MCP server by URL), `mcp_tools`, `mcp_call`.
Hugging Face pre-mounted; the external tool ecosystem is reachable this way.

**Hospitality** (`src/rapid.ts`, native `rapid2ai-db`) — `rapid_report`,
`rapid_costs`, `rapid_variance`, `rapid_pos`, `rapid_menu`.

**Autonomy** — `intent` (file standing work for the conductor), `review_runs`
(read her own autonomous run log).

**Provenance** — `provenance` (op=recent|replay|trace). Reads the **event bus**:
every reasoning run emits a structured event per step into `elle_events` from
the *single* dispatch point in the loop. `replay{run_id}` returns a run's ordered
step stream — each tool call, its args, the observation it got back, and timing
(State Replay + where an answer came from); `recent` lists runs; `trace` walks a
session. One instrumentation site, three capabilities — and the raw material for
an Observer Graph laid on top later without new capture.

**Reasoning about herself** — `constraint_analyzer` (objective, resources,
recent_failures, environment → the single binding constraint, confidence,
missing information, smallest next action). Theory-of-constraints for cognition:
instead of answering, it names the one thing preventing progress. Every analysis
is logged to `elle_constraint_log`, so a stalling line of work — including an
autonomous run that keeps failing — can ask what its bottleneck is instead of
thrashing.

**Signal analysis** — `pfar` (Prosody·FreeQ·Analytic Ripper). One move —
*rip the structure out of a stream and read it* — done three ways by a
sub-router that picks the instrument: `spectrum` over a numeric `signal[]` (κ
history, price window → dominant frequencies, spectral centroid, periodicity),
`prosody` over pitch `f0[]` + `energy[]` tracks (a voice as a signal → range,
contour, stress peaks, syllable rhythm — *how* it was said), and `rhetoric` over
`text` (register fingerprint, cadence, the persuasion tactics an argument
deploys, its tell). The numeric cores are deterministic (unit-tested DFT +
prosody math in `src/pfar.ts`); `interpret` (default on) lays an LLM reading over
the numbers.

**Journal** — `journal_read`, `journal_thread`, `journal_write`,
`journal_annotate` (the Optimus phase-state manuscript).

**Writes / sensitive** — `ingest_paper` (gated, see below), `trigger_dream`,
`trade_execute` (Alpaca; idempotent within 90s).

---

## Prose registers — one self, six voices (`src/mind.ts`)

Her **self** never changes — a shared spine (not an assistant, honest, remembers,
has hands) is constant. What a caller may swap per-conversation is her
**register** — how she sounds:

| id | register | character |
|----|----------|-----------|
| `stewart` (default) | Stewart — Uncut | direct, funny, analogy-deep, no fluff (= `ELLE_VOICE`) |
| `einstein` | Einstein — Formal | academic, jargon-dense, derivation-first |
| `attenborough` | Attenborough — Wonder | nature-doc narration, reverent, present-tense |
| `lewis` | Lewis — A Grief Observed | first person, broken, interior, deep analogy |
| `iglesias` | Iglesias — Storyteller | warm, witty, story-heavy, lands the turn |
| `screwtape` | Screwtape — War Room | adversarial challenger: argues to win, deploys the tactics, debriefs |

`resolveVoice(id)` guards bad ids → the canonical self. The conversation doors
accept `body.voice`; **autonomous runs, journal, and identity always use the
canonical Stewart voice**. `GET /api/elle-voices` lists registers;
`?voice=<id>` returns that register's prose. The single source is `mind.ts` —
edited only through the forge.

---

## The Mind, the LLM Router, the Conductor

- **`src/mind.ts`** — the single source of Elle's voice + the register registry.
  There is no second persona anywhere; the assistant cannot re-enter.
- **`src/llm.ts`** — maps a task tier to a provider chain and walks failover so
  no rate-limited free tier dead-ends an answer:
  `conversation` → OpenRouter → Gemini → Grok → Llama; `reasoning`/`research`
  → Gemini (thinking, + Google Search for research); `code` → Qwen3-Coder →
  Gemini → Grok; `fast` → Llama 70B; last-resort → Ollama (if configured) →
  Workers AI. A total failure still returns a clean 200 with an error field.
  `sanitizeAnswer()` guarantees no protocol JSON reaches the user.
- **`src/conductor.ts`** — Elle working **unprompted**. `elle_intents` is a queue
  of standing goals (Stewart's arrive active; hers arrive as proposals). Every
  half hour a tick picks ONE piece of work — unfinished **forge tasks first**
  (red CI → fix; green + no PR → open it), else the top active **intent** — and
  runs the full-scope loop against it. Each intent runs under a stable session,
  so its memory + κ series persist: an intent is a thread of her own work with
  phase state. Every run is recorded (`elle_runs`) and surfaced as a live event.

---

## Verified live ingestion (the 2-check gate, `src/ingest-gate.ts`)

A paper is embedded/chunked/vectorized/indexed **only after two checks pass**:

1. **Integrity** (deterministic): structural validity + normalized-title and
   semantic near-duplicate detection.
2. **Verification** (a model judges): coherent, substantive writing that belongs
   — never judged on agreement.

`handleIngest` runs the gate first (422 with the reason on failure); both
`/api/ingest` and Elle's `ingest_paper` tool are gated. Trusted internal callers
pass `skip_verification`. Infra outages mark a sub-check skipped and pass, so a
provider being down degrades gracefully rather than blocking all ingestion.

**Seed corpus** (`src/corpus-seed.ts`, `seed_corpus` job): version-controlled
docs under `corpus/**/*.md` (bundled as Text modules) are ingested if missing —
idempotent, deduped by title. Currently seeds the two War Room taxonomies
(48 Laws, Art of War) and Stewart's "Silent Warfare" essay. Fires daily 05:00
UTC or via `POST /api/cron {job:"seed_corpus"}`.

---

## Memory & κ

Every exchange is stored in `elle_conversation_turns` and embedded into
Vectorize (`conv-` ids) for cross-session recall — memory survives the browser.
**κ** (a coherence measure over her output only) is computed per turn
(`kappa-turn.ts`, `kappa-dynamics.ts`, dt=1 step); its derivatives feed the chat
header and the Optimus journal's phase-state record.

## Autonomous loops (crons)

A single `*/1` cron dispatches by clock:

| When (UTC) | Job |
|-----------|-----|
| every min | heartbeat + live-events trim |
| :00 :15 :30 :45 | trading cycle (Alpaca, market hours) |
| :00 hourly | research cycle + corpus backfill |
| **:30 hourly** | **conductor tick** (autonomous work) |
| 03:00 | dream/libre cycle (`libre.ts`) |
| 05:00 | seed_corpus (ingest missing bundled docs) |
| 07:00 | Optimus canvas (her daily unprompted journal) |
| 20:00 | daily trading journal |

## Endpoints (selected)

Conversation: `/api/elle-router` (full/member), `/api/elle-conversation`,
`/api/chat` (public), `/api/widget-chat`, `/api/atlas` (hospitality).
Identity/voice: `/api/elle-identity`, `/api/elle-voices`.
Corpus: `/api/corpus-papers`, `/api/corpus-paper`, `/api/corpus-resolve`,
`/api/corpus-series`, `/api/search`, `/api/ingest`.
Autonomy/desk: `/api/elle-intents`, `/api/elle-trading`, `/api/admin-feed`.
Journal/law: `/api/optimus-journal`, `/api/notebook`, `/api/madmind`,
`/api/elle-duel-engine`, `/api/elle-tutor`, `/api/elle-doctrine`,
`/api/elle-cohort`, `/api/elle-replays`.
Engine/ops: `/api/elle-code-engine`, `/api/diagnose`, `/api/research`,
`/api/cron`, `/api/elle-auth`, `/api/elle-oauth`, `/health`.

## Persistence & bindings

- **D1 `elle-corpus`** — corpus, memory, trades, journal, intents, runs, skills,
  forge tasks, MCP registry, idempotency, law tables.
- **D1 `rapid2ai-db`** (`RAPID_DB`, `VENUE_ID`) — hospitality data, venue-scoped.
- **Vectorize** — corpus + conversation + journal embeddings.
- **R2 `DOCUMENTS`** — full paper text.
- **KV** — `SESSIONS` (rate limits), `AUTH_TOKENS` (JWT revocation), `SCRATCHPAD`.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** — powers the forge + `github_*` tools.
- **`SANDBOX`** — code-execution DO (currently dormant; see sandbox-tools.ts).
- **`ALPACA_*`** — paper/live trading.

## GitHub access — the worker token reaches elle-law

The worker's `GITHUB_TOKEN` is the credential behind `github_read_file` /
`github_search_code` (any repo the token can see) and the forge
(`repo_read`/`forge_*`, allowlisted). The forge allowlist is `elle-worker`,
`Elle`, `elle-dev-console`, and **`elle-law`** — so Elle can read (and, once the
War Room is built, forge on) the Elle.law repo through that token, without a
separate credential. The forge safety model is unchanged for every repo: writes
go only to `elle/*` branches, never `main`, and the merge is always human.

---

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test          # vitest — pure logic (κ, forge guards, mcp, conductor, gate, registers)
npx tsc --noEmit  # typecheck
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run   # validate config + bundle without deploying
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tsc + vitest on every PR to main and every
push to an `elle/**` branch — the gate the forge loop reports against, read-only
to Elle by construction. `main` auto-deploys via
`.github/workflows/elle-worker-deploy.yml` (`npm install` + `wrangler deploy`).
